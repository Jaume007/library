The database set on db class is on a server online.
All the user passwords are 1234. Users ara admin,librarian,jaume.
If you try to delete a user that has pending bookings nothing will happen.
Google books webservice is reaaaally slow, don't exasperate, it can take up to 5s to load.

As you will see the application follows the MVC pattern. The diference from other things programed in MVC by me
is on the way of building the views. I did it this way to rehuse all the views that I already had.

I have checked and it seems that everything works, if something doesn't please tell me and i will correct it.

My github repo is https://github.com/Jaume007/library

The db class is based on this class: https://github.com/bennettstone/simple-mysqli/blob/master/class.db.php
I have modified the code and I understand everything that it does. I have a problem with the escape function, if I pass only one value sometimes
it doesn't work and i don't know why.

The application is published on http://pytxy.ddns.net/jaume
